Basic Learning of Natural Language Processing : 
These Step before processing and dealing with any text-formatted Data
1. Tokenization : Process of separating a piece of text into smaller units called tokens
2. Stemming : Process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root formâ€”generally a written word form
3. Lemmatization : In contrast to stemming, lemmatization looks beyond word reduction, and considers a language's full vocabulary to apply a morphological analysis to words.
4. Removing Stop words : What is stop words? is a list of collection word which does not add much meaning to a sentence. These word can safely be ignored without sacrificing the meaning of the sentence.
